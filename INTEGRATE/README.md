# 24.711: The Modern History of Modal Logic (Coursework)

> A private repository including the readings and problem sets for [_24.711: The Modern History of Modal Logic_](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistory).

## Readings

## Problem Sets

> Eight problem sets to be completed collectively.

The problem sets follow the [Logic Notes](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/LogicNotes) which I will be revising and extending before each assignment.
These notes are extremely terse, so if there are parts that don't make sense, please raise a question in the issues and we can chat about it there.
This will help to include others in the conversation and help me to improve the notes.

The problem sets are to be completed in collaboration with your peers.
More information is provided in the [collaboration](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistoryPrivate/blob/master/problem_sets/collaboration.md) document about how to use Git to work effectively together.

In addition to the relevant portion of the Logic Notes and the collaboration overview, please read the instructions for each week linked below.
These instructions will provide some discussion of the problem set for that week.

## Final Project

The final project constitutes 40% of the grade for the formal track and 80% for the historical track. Students will present their project outlines in the final seminar.

### Historical Track

- Write a 5,000 word term paper on course literature or related topics
- Brief presentation (~10 minutes) in final seminar
- Schedule meeting to discuss topic before preparing outline

### Formal Track (Choose One)

- **Mathematical**: Present and explain an important formal result
  - Focus on classic results in one of the logics we covered (or related)
  - Emphasis on clear presentation and interpretation
- **Programmatic**: Conduct semantic studies using the model-checker
  - Build and document a model-checker project
  - Analyze countermodels and logical consequences
  - Present findings in Jupyter notebook

For complete details, see the [Final Projects](final_projects/final_projects.md) document.
