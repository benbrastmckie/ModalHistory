   > Material implication, it will appear, applies to any world in which the all-possible is the real, and cannot apply to a world in which there is a difference between real and possible, between false and absurd. Strict implication has a wider range of application. Most importantly; it admits of the distinction of true and necessary, of false and meaningless.

 * Page #3:
   > The 'either-or' which is equivalent to the negative of a product, are not themselves identical or even equivalent. 'Either to-day is not Monday or it is raining'--- equivalent to the negative of a product is not equivalent to 'to-day is Monday implies that it is raining'. The 'either-or' which is equivalent to an implication is intensional disjunction, the 'either-or'  of the dilemma.

 * Page #3: footnote 1
   > Nevertheless a calculus in logic may be, as pure mathematics, true; as applied mathematics, either absolutely or pragmatically false.

 * Page #4:
   > The disjunction which is equivalent to extensional disjunction: its distinguishing characteristic is the fact that it is satisfied merely by the truth of one member.

 * Page #4:
   > The intensional 'either p or q' means 'it is _impossible_ that p and q should both be false; if either were false, the other would necessarily be true; the negation of either (strictly) implies the other'.  The extensional 'either p or q' means 'it happens to be the fact that at least one of the propositions, p and q, is true; it is not true that p and q are both false; the product, not-p not-q is false'.

 * Page #6:
   > It is easy to demonstrate that an infinity of such absurd propositions follow from the assumptions of material implication. The significant and useful theorems of that calculus thus appear to be, like Gratiano's reasons, two grains of wheat. That they are not hid in two bushels of chaff is due to the restraining intelligence which manipulates the system.

 * Page #6:
   > In such a world, all-possible must be necessary, the contingent cannot exist, the false must be absurd and impossible, and the contrary to fact supposition must be quite meaningless.

 * Page #6:
   > [T]he true must necessarily true, true _a priori_, if " a proposition is implied by any proposition ".

 * Page #6:
   > [T]he contingent cannot exist, since all facts will be necessarily as they are, and the truth about them a prori.

 * Page #7:
   > The system of strict implication distinguishes the false from the absurd, the merely contrary to fact from the impossible, and the merely true--- the contingent--- from the necessarily true whose very denial implies it. In strict implication the theorem, 'Any true proposition is implied by its own denial,' does not appear.  But its converse, 'Any proposition which is implied by its own denial is true,' still holds.

 * Page #7:
   > That the merely contrary to fact implies anything is repugnant to common sense.  But does the impossible--- the absurd supposition--- imply anything and everything? And is the necessarily true, whose denial is absurd, implied by any proposition whatever? When we include S9 in our list of postulates we assume that this is the case, as will appear from the following consequences of that postulate.

 * Page #8:
   > If one object that absurdities imply anything,a at the necessarily true is  implied by anything, then it is only necessary to substitute M6, p +  (q + r)] v [q +  (p + r), for S9, p v (q + r)] v [q v (p + r).  This change will eliminate the above theorems and others which have a like significance. Some of these at least, are exemplified in our everyday reasoning.

 * Page #8:
   > If we ask, now, whether the actual world is such a one as material implication may apply to, the answer is not self-evident. Here, again, we are reminded of rival geometries. We do not discover the necessity of all facts, nor the absurdity of every contrary to fact hypothesis. Nor are we able to verify that ubiquity of the implication relation demanded by material implication. One may thus maintain that the real is not the all-possible, that reality is, in some part, contingent and not necessary, that the multiverse of things 'hang together by their edges,' and, consequently, that the system of material implication is false as an applied logic.  But an obvious reply has it that this is a generalisation from our ignorance,--- that our belief in the contingent and the false but not absurd, is due to the smallness of our ken.

 * Page #8:
   > Pragmatically, however, implication is an obviously false logic.  If 'p implies q' means only 'it is false that p is true and q false,' then the implication relation is far too ubiquitous to be of any use.  If we ask for the consequences of any proposition, we are immediately confronted with all the truths we can think of. If we are so foolish as to make a condition contrary to fact, we must at once accept its own contradictory as the logical result. Not only is such reasoning applicable only to a monistic universe,  but it is suited only to infinite wisdom.

 * Page #8:
   > [The] few theorems present propositions clearly reveals its meaning of 'implies'--- and the infinity like them which are omitted--- are not capable of _any_ proper use as rules for reasoning.

 * Page #9:
   > But even if, in the end, one prefer the false simplicity of material implication, this much at least, remains clear; the present calculus of propositions is only one among a  number of such systems, each of which may be self-consistent and a possible choice as an applied logic.
