### "Implication and the Algebra of Logic" (1912)

> Last time we saw...

- Inchoate conception and motivations driving Lewis
  - A logic of the possible and necessary, not just the actual
  - Necessary as something like, or including, the _a priori_
  - Aim to extend the vocabulary that PM introduces is a good one
- Motivation
  - What should we require of a new program in logic?
  - Perfectly clear theoretical target is too much to ask
  - Methodology for developing the logic
  - Consistency is vital
  - Motivation from the inadequacies of the existing systems
    - Avoid absurd propositions (these indicate limited meaning of 'implies')
    - Provide a better reading of 'implies'
  - Intended applications (theoretical role)
    - Some appeal what can be known _a priori_
    - Some appeal to the ability to test/reason about scientific hypotheses
  - Stipulated systems ultimately draw on abductive support
- Anachronism
  - Compare the extensional and intensional algebras
  - Some grounds for resonance with what Lewis writes
  - Wants to reason about the possible not just the actual

### "The Calculus of Strict Implication" (1914)

- Motivation
  - [p. 241] Material implication, "cannot apply to a world in which there is a difference between real and possible, between false and absurd"
  - Strict implication, "admits of the distinction of true and necessary, of false and meaningless."
  - [FN 1] Pragmatic, writing, "a calculus in logic may be, as pure mathematics, true; as applied mathematics, either absolutely or pragmatically false."
  - [p. 242] Contrasts intensional disjunction as, "it is _impossible_ that p and q should both be false" as opposed to extensional disjunction as, "it happens to be the fact that at least one of the propositions, p and q, is true".
- Systems
  - [p. 243] M1 - M7 vs S1 - S11
  - Notes the absence of the paradoxes from the system of strict implication
  - [p. 244] Aim to distinguish the useful theorems writing, "It is easy to demonstrate that an infinity of such absurd propositions follow from the assumptions of material implication. The significant and useful theorems of that calculus thus appear to be, like Gratiano's reasons, two grains of wheat. That they are not hid in two bushels of chaff is due to the restraining intelligence which manipulates the system."
  - Falsely claims that, "These theorems are absurd only in the sense that they are utterly in applicable to our modes of inference and proof."
- Interpretation
  - Characterizes, "the nature of any world to which this system of material implication would apply," as:
    - "In such a world, all-possible must be necessary, the contingent cannot exist, the false must be absurd and impossible, and the contrary to fact supposition must be quite meaningless."
    - "[T]he true must necessarily true, true _a priori_, if 'a proposition is implied by any proposition'."
    - "[T]he contingent cannot exist, since all facts will be necessarily as they are, and the truth about them _a prori_."
    - [p.245] "[T]he false will be impossible and absurd"
  - By contrast, "The system of strict implication distinguishes the false from the absurd, the merely contrary to fact from the impossible, and the merely true--- the contingent--- from the necessarily true whose very denial implies it."
    - Considers paradoxes of strict implication, "That the merely contrary to fact implies anything is repugnant to common sense.  But does the impossible--- the absurd supposition--- imply anything and everything? And is the necessarily true, whose denial is absurd, implied by any proposition whatever?"
  - Are there contingent propositions?
    - [p.246] "If we ask, now, whether the actual world is such a one as material implication may apply to, the answer is not self-evident. Here, again, we are reminded of rival geometries. We do not discover the necessity of all facts, nor the absurdity of every contrary to fact hypothesis. Nor are we able to verify that ubiquity of the implication relation demanded by material implication. One may thus maintain that the real is not the all-possible, that reality is, in some part, contingent and not necessary, that the multiverse of things 'hang together by their edges,' and, consequently, that the system of material implication is false as an applied logic.  But an obvious reply has it that this is a generalisation from our ignorance,--- that our belief in the contingent and the false but not absurd, is due to the smallness of our ken. A decision on metaphysical grounds would thus be doubtful."
    - "Pragmatically, however, implication is an obviously false logic.  If 'p implies q' means only 'it is false that p is true and q false,' then the implication relation is far too ubiquitous to be of any use.  If we ask for the consequences of any proposition, we are immediately confronted with all the truths we can think of. If we are so foolish as to make a condition contrary to fact, we must at once accept its own contradictory as the logical result. Not only is such reasoning applicable only to a monistic universe,  but it is suited only to infinite wisdom."
    - "[The] few theorems present propositions clearly reveals its meaning of 'implies'--- and the infinity like them which are omitted--- are not capable of _any_ proper use as rules for reasoning."
- Outlook
  - [p. 247] "But even if, in the end, one prefer the false simplicity of material implication, this much at least, remains clear; the present calculus of propositions is only one among a  number of such systems, each of which may be self-consistent and a possible choice as an applied logic."
