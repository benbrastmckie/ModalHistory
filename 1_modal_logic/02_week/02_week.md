# [Week 02](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistory/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#week-02-quantified-modal-logic-tuesday-feb-18-due-to-presidents-day)

>[!Tip]
> One way to download the readings for this week is to `Sync Changes` in VSCodium (or equivalent).
> Then they will be on your hard drive and read to open with your preferred pdf viewer.

>[!Note]
> There will be a lot fewer readings in the following weeks.
> Thankfully many of these are short.
