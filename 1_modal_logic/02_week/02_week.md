There will be a lot fewer readings in the following weeks.
Thankfully many of the reading this week are short.
But all of this controversy makes for many natural presentation topics.

- Purely designative occurrences of names
  - Claims this is novel (what Frege calls 'ungerade' or 'oblique')
  - substitution as a test
  - A context is opaque if substitution fails
  - Quotation creates an opaque context
  - So does 'is unaware that', 'believes that', 'is so-called' etc.
- Existential generalization licensed for purely designative occurrences
  - There is no such thing as Pegasus (can't existentially generalize)
  - Giorgione was so-called because of his size (can't existentially generalize)
  - Giorgione was called 'Giorgione' because of his size (can existentially generalize)
- Analytic necessity: '$\varphi$' is analytic
  - '9 > 7' is analytic (true)
  - 'The number of planets > 7' is analytic (false)
  - 'If there is life on the Evening Star, then there is life on the Morning star' is analytic (false)
  - Shows that analytic necessity creates an opaque context
- Quantification
  - Quantifiers can exist on the inside of 'Nec'
  - But quantifiers can't bind variables inside the scope of 'Nec'
  - $\exists x('x'$ has three letters) from "'Cat' has three letters" is like $\exists$(the xle are stampeding)"

- Takes Quine to task not citing Frege for 'purely designative'
- Variables should have an intensional range composed of attributes rather than classes

## **Barcan, Ruth C. "A Functional Calculus of First Order Based on Strict Implication." The Journal of Symbolic Logic 11, no. 4 (1946): 115–18. https://doi.org/10.2307/2269159.**

- Extends Lewis and Langford's system
  - Takes the $\Diamond$ to be primitive instead of defined
  - McKinsey 1945 tries to define the modal (her undergraduate supervisor)
  - Fitch 1937 also tries to define the modal (her graduate supervisor)
- Barcan formula
  - Main result is 19 to distribute quantification over strict implication
  - Natural if strict implication is to subsume the role of material implication
- Paradoxes
  - Points out that paradoxes are not derivable
  - Shows that she was working within the broad spirit of Lewis and Langford

## **Quine, W. V. "The Problem of Interpreting Modal Logic." The Journal of Symbolic Logic 12, no. 2 (1947): 43–48. https://doi.org/10.2307/2267247.**

- Analyzing modality
  - Claims that the modals are not clear otherwise
  - Analytic is the reading he claims to understand
  - This is then understood in terms of synonymy
  - [p.44] Admits contextual dependence
- Barcan Formula
  - Could try to move modals to the outside
  - Doesn't work for mixed modal statements
- Morning Star and Evening Star puzzle
  - So many objects are 'congruent' to the Morning star
  - Quine concludes that the modal logician repudiates material objects

## Smullyan, Arthur Francis. “Review: W. V. Quine, The Problem of Interpreting Modal Logic.” The Journal of Symbolic Logic 12, no. 4 (1947): 139–41.

- Quine's puzzle
  - If constants then B is false
  - If definite descriptions, then A is false
  - [p.140] It is not necessary that the morning star exists (or is self-identical)

## Smullyan, Arthur Francis. “Modality and Description.” The Journal of Symbolic Logic 13, no. 1 (1948): 31–37.

- [p.34] "modal paradoxes arise not out of any intrinsic absurdity in the use of the modal operators but rather out of the assumption that descriptive phrases are names."

## Barcan, Ruth C. “Review: Arthur Francis Smullyan, Modality and Description.” The Journal of Symbolic Logic 13, no. 3 (1948): 149–50.

- [p.150] "In a system of the kind with which Smullyan is presumably concerned, an unrestricted substitution theorem can be proved only for expressions which are logically equivalent." 
  - Only strict equivalents may be freely substituted for each other
  - But she shows that identities strictly imply strict equivalence

## Fitch, Frederic B. “The Problem of the Morning Star and the Evening Star.” Philosophy of Science 16, no. 2 (April 1949): 137–41.

- "It is necessary that the MS is identical with the MS"
  - Smullyan takes this to entail that false claim that necessarily the MS exists
- Change of scope
  - The MS is nec self-identical (nec takes narrow scope)
  - This is true given that the MS exists
  - Cites's Barcan's necessity of identity
- "It is not necessary that the ES is the MS"
  - A similar narrow reading makes 4 false
  - Claims that the puzzle is resolved by scope ambiguity


## Quine, W. V. "Three Grades of Modal Involvement." In Proceedings of the 11th International Congress of Philosophy, 14:65–81. Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1953.

- Reduction ad essentialism
  - Quine derives that everything is necessarily self-identical
  - Shows that everything has some properties necessarily and others only accidentally
  - Can't be dismissed by a distinction between names and definite descriptions
- If these conclusions are to be accepted, how is one to maintain a logical reading of the modals?
  - It is no part of the logic to say what properties objects have or fail to have
  - Could go substitutional, but then small languages will have truths about how many objects there are
  - Also there could be unnamed objects
