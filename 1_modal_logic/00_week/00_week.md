## Course Overview

1) Philosophical Logic

  - Conceptual engineering
  - Historical development
  - Formal theories
  - Methodology
    - Proof theory
    - Model theory
    - Verification
  - Course Goals
    - Gain familiarity with modal logic
    - Logic was not give to us by god
    - Unravel its untidy origins
    - Study the effects on philosophy
    - Build perspective towards new theories
2) Four Modules
  - Module 1: Modal Logic
    - Paradoxes of the material conditional
    - Earl proof systems
    - Quantified modal logic
    - Quine's criticisms
  - Module 2: Intensional Semantics
    - Carnap's semantics
    - Kripke's semantics
    - Tense logics
    - Bimodal logics
  - Module 3: Counterfactual Conditionals
    - Similarity semantics
    - Imposition semantics
    - Mereological semantics
  - Module 4: Constitutive Explanation
    - Identity and Aboutness
    - Necessary and Sufficient
3) Course Requirements
  - Historical Track
    - [80%] Write a final term paper (5k words)
      - Historical or contemporary
    - [10%] Present a topic in class (15min)
      - Discuss a paper or topic
      - Revising the class notes for that week
    - [10%] Open five [issues](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistory/issues)
      - Raise a substantial question or make an observation
      - Answer a question or otherwise engage with an existing issue
      - Include issue links along with your term paper for review
  - Formal Track
    - [40%] Make substantial contributions to all eight collaborative problem sets
    - [40%] Complete and present a final project by either:
      - Presenting and discussing an important formal result
      - Using the model-checker to implement a semantics
    - [10%] Present a topic in class (ditto above)
    - [10%] Open five [issues](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistory/issues) (ditto above)
4. Course Materials
  - Public repository
    - Class notes
    - Issues
  - Private repository
    - Readings
    - Problem sets
    - Create an account on GitHub to gain access to the private repository
5. Tools (formal track)
  - Set up a text editor for using the [model-checker](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModelChecker)
    - Details are provided for using VSCodium
    - I recommend installing LaTeX if you have not already done so
    - I recommend using Zotero to collect readings for this course
  - Use Git to contribute to problem sets
    - VSCodium/VSCode make this very easy
