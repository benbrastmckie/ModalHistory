2) Four Modules
  - Module 1: Modal Logic
    - Paradoxes of the material conditional
    - Earl proof systems
    - Quantified modal logic
    - Quine's criticisms
  - Module 2: Intensional Semantics
    - Carnap's semantics
    - Kripke's semantics
    - Tense logics
    - Bimodal logics
  - Module 3: Counterfactual Conditionals
    - Similarity semantics
    - Imposition semantics
    - Mereological semantics
  - Module 4: Constitutive Explanation
    - Identity and Aboutness
    - Necessary and Sufficient
3) Course Requirements
  - Historical Track
    - [80%] Write a final term paper (5k words)
      - Historical or contemporary
    - [10%] Present a topic in class (15min)
      - Discuss a paper or topic
      - Revising the class notes for that week
    - [10%] Open five [issues](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistory/issues)
      - Raise a substantial question or make an observation
      - Answer a question or otherwise engage with an existing issue
      - Include issue links along with your term paper for review
  - Formal Track
    - [40%] Make substantial contributions to all eight collaborative problem sets
    - [40%] Complete and present a final project by either:
      - Presenting and discussing an important formal result
      - Using the model-checker to implement a semantics
    - [10%] Present a topic in class (ditto above)
    - [10%] Open five [issues](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistory/issues) (ditto above)
4. Course Materials
  - Public repository
    - Class notes
    - Issues
  - Private repository
    - Readings
    - Problem sets
    - Create an account on GitHub to gain access to the private repository
5. Tools (formal track)
  - Set up a text editor for using the [model-checker](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModelChecker)
    - Details are provided for using VSCodium
    - I recommend installing LaTeX if you have not already done so
    - I recommend using Zotero to collect readings for this course
  - Use Git to contribute to problem sets
    - VSCodium/VSCode makes this very easy

## Lecture

### Principia Mathematica

- The meaning of 'implies'

### Strict Implication

- The meaning of 'implies'
  - "They exhibit only, in sharp outline, the meaning of " implies " which has been incorporated into the algebra."
  - "Such an attempt might be superfluous were it not that certain confusions of interpretation are involved, and that the expositors of the algebra of logic have not always taken pains to indicate that there is a difference between the algebraic and the ordinary meanings of implication."
  - "One may suspect that some of them would deny the divergence, or at least would maintain that the technical use is preferable and ought generally to be adopted."
  - Definition: $p \rightarrow q \coloneq \neg p \vee q$
