# [Week 00](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistory?tab=readme-ov-file#week-00-introduction-and-origins)

This week will present the ambitions for this seminar before presenting the system of material implication developed in _Principia Mathematica_ and Lewis' early essays motivating the development of a logic of strict implication by appealing to the paradoxes of material implication.
