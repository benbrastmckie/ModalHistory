# [Week 00](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistory?tab=readme-ov-file#week-00-introduction-and-origins)

This week will present an overview of the seminar before presenting the system of material implication developed in _Principia Mathematica_ and Lewis' early essays motivating the development of a logic of strict implication.

## Course Overview

1) Plan
  - Introduction to philosophical logic 
  - Course overview
  - Paradoxes of material implication
2) Philosophical Logic
  - Historical development
    - Logic has developed quickly since mid 1800s
    - Modal logic is a nice filter (well contained)
    - Perspective (logic was not give to us by god)
    - Good theories (strong and simple)
    - Success story (real philosophical progress)
    - Modal logic has been hugely influential
  - Formal methodology
    - Contrast mathematical logic
    - Conceptual engineering
    - Proof theory
    - Model theory
    - Verification
  - Course goals
    - Unravel the recent origins of modal logic
    - Gain familiarity with modal logic
    - Learn the methods that have supported its development
    - Build perspective towards new theories
  - There is a lot we won't do
    - Applications (philosophy, linguistics, CS)
    - Metalogic
3) Four Modules
  - Module 1: Modal Logic

5. Course Materials
  - Public repository
    - Syllabus
    - Bibliography
    - Issues
  - Private repository
    - Readings
    - Class notes
