# 24.711: The Modern History of Modal Logic

> A graduate course in _Philosophical Logic_ at MIT covering the modern history of modal logic.

**Description:** The seminar will cover the modern history of modal logic, focusing on the development of both its proof theories and semantic systems. (1) The first module will begin with C.I. Lewis' systems of strict implication 1912 - 1932, focusing on their early motivations and interpretations. The module will conclude with Ruth Barcan Marcus' first-order extensions of the systems of strict implication 1946 and the critiques raised by Quine 1943 - 1947 that modal logic will lead back into the "jungle of Aristotelian metaphysics". (2) The second module will focus on the development of intensional semantics by comparing Carnap 1946 and Kripke's 1963 accounts. We will then consider Prior's 1967 tense logics and some of the early attempts to fit these semantic systems together in Montague 1973, Fine 1977, and Kaplan 1989. This module will conclude with Dor and Goodman 2020 paper along with an alternative bimodal system that I have developed. (3) The third module will begin with the intensional semantics for counterfactuals developed by Stalnaker 1968 and Lewis 1973. We will then move to review some of the early criticisms by Fine 1975 and others, comparing the hyperintensional account that Fine 2012 offers as an alternative. I will then present the extension that I have developed of Fine's semantics for counterfactuals. (4) The fourth module will close by considering hyperintensional semantic theories and their logics for propositional identity, subject-matter, essence, ground, and logical subtraction.

## Overview

The course will be divided into the four modules indicated below.
Students taking the course for credit may choose between the _formal track_ which fulfills the logic requirement and the _historical track_ which does not.
Grades will be determined accordingly:

### Formal Track

- [10%] Present a topic in class, revising the class notes for that week
- [10%] Open two [issues](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistory/issues) to raise a substantial question or make an observation
- [40%] Make substantial contributions to all eight collaborative problem sets
- [40%] Complete a final project by either:
  - Presenting and discussing an important formal result
  - Use the model-checker to implement a semantics

### Historical Track

- [10%] Present a topic in class, revising the class notes for that week
- [10%] Open two [issues](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistory/issues) to raise a substantial question or make an observation
- [80%] Write a final term paper (5k words)

### Tooling

Although optional for students on the _historical track_, the first problem set for students on the _formal track_ will consist of:
- Installing either [VSCodium](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/VSCodium), [NeoVim](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/.config), or equivalent for writing in markdown, LaTeX, as well as using the [model-checker](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModelChecker) to complete the final problem set at the end of the course (instructions will be provided).
- Accepting the invitation to the private problem set repo for this course, adding an SSH key.
- Using Git to push changes to the installation documentation (collaboration is encouraged on all problem sets).
