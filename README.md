# The Modern History of Modal Logic

> A graduate course (24.711) in _Philosophical Logic_ at MIT covering the modern history of modal logic.

## Overview

The course will be divided into the five modules indicated below.
Students taking the course for credit may choose between the _formal track_ which fulfills the logic requirement and the _historical track_ which does not.
Grades will be determined accordingly:

### Formal Track

- [10%] Present a topic in class, revising the class notes for that week
- [10%] Open two [issues](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistory/issues) to raise a substantial question or make an observation
- [40%] Make substantial contributions to all eight collaborative problem sets
- [40%] Complete a final project by either:
  - Presenting and discussing an important formal result
  - Use the model-checker to implement a semantics

### Historical Track

- [10%] Present a topic in class, revising the class notes for that week
- [10%] Open two [issues](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistory/issues) to raise a substantial question or make an observation
- [80%] Write a final term paper (5k words)

### Tooling

Although optional for students on the _historical track_, the first problem set for students on the _formal track_ will consist of:
- Installing either [VSCodium](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/VSCodium), [NeoVim](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/.config), or equivalent for writing in markdown, LaTeX, as well as using the [model-checker](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModelChecker) to complete the final problem set at the end of the course (instructions will be provided).
- Accepting the invitation to the private problem set repo for this course, adding an SSH key.
- Using Git to push changes to the installation documentation (collaboration is encouraged on all problem sets).
