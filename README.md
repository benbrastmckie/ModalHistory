# The Modern History of Modal Logic

> A graduate course (24.711) in _Philosophical Logic_ at MIT covering the modern history of modal logic.

## Overview

The course will be divided into the seven modules indicated below.
Students taking the course for credit may choose between the _formal track_ which fulfills the logic requirement and the _historical track_ which does not.
Grades will be determined accordingly:

### Formal Track

- Present a topic in class
- Make substantial contributions to all eight collaborative problem sets
- Open two issues to raise a question or make a substantive observation
- Complete a final project by either:
  - Presenting and discussing a classic formal result
  - Use the model-checker to implement a semantics

### Historical Track

- A presentation
- Opening two issues about which you have a question or substantive observation
- A final term paper (5k words)

### Tooling

Although optional for students on the _historical track_, the first problem set for students on the _formal track_ will consist of:
- Installing [VSCodium](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/VSCodium), [NeoVim](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/.config), or equivalent for writing in markdown, LaTeX, as well as using the [model-checker](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModelChecker) to complete the final problem set at the end of the course.
- Using Git to push changes to the installation documentation by either explaining how you set up your text editor or else improving existing documentation (collaboration is encouraged on all problem sets).
