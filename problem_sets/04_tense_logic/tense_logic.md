# [Problem Set #4: Tense Logic](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistory?tab=readme-ov-file#problem-sets)

> Problem Set #4: Tense Logic (due prior to class week 06)

This problem set explores tense logic as developed by Arthur Prior and extended by Richmond Thomason, applying modal techniques to reasoning about time.

## Background

Tense logic treats temporal operators as modal operators, providing a formal system for reasoning about time. Prior's work established the foundations of tense logic, while Thomason extended these systems to address issues like indeterminism and the logic of the future.

This problem set builds on our previous work with modal logic but applies it to temporal reasoning, exploring how the framework can be adapted to a new domain with its own unique challenges.

## Instructions

1. Complete the proofs and exercises in the `04_solutions.tex` file provided in this directory.
2. Follow the collaboration guidelines outlined in the [Problem Sets README](/problem_sets/README.md).
3. Make sure to add your name to the problems you're working on before beginning.
4. Pay special attention to the semantics of the temporal operators and how they relate to the more familiar modal operators we've studied.
5. Consider the philosophical implications of different models of time (linear, branching, dense, etc.).

## Resources

- Review the tense logic sections in the [Logic Notes](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/LogicNotes)
- Prior's "Past, Present and Future" and "Time and Modality"
- Thomason's "Indeterminist Time and Truth-Value Gaps"

Tense logic provides an excellent case study in how modal techniques can be adapted to different domains. The formal systems we develop reflect philosophical commitments about the nature of time, demonstrating the close connection between logic and metaphysics.
