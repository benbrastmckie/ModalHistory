# [Problem Set #4: Tense Logic](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistory?tab=readme-ov-file#problem-sets)

This problem set concerns the semantics for _propositional tense logic_.
Please read the relevant portion of the [Logic Notes](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/LogicNotes) for the definitions.
A number of definitions are included in the [notation.sty](../assets/notation.sty) file.
As always, feel free to open issues if there is anything that it would be helpful to discuss.

## Problem Set

> Overview of the sections in the problem set.

There are fifty problems, five of which I provided as example solutions.
Work together to complete the [solutions](04_solutions.tex) by writing 5/50 solutions for the problems for this week.
General information is provided in the [collaboration](../README.md#collaboration) document.

## Regimentation

We have two languages to consider.
Whereas the first language includes the tense operators in addition to the extensional operators, the second language also includes the _inevitability_ operators.
These provide a number of options for regimenting the English sentences that have been provided.

## Temporal Frame Constraints

This section concerns the definition of temporal frames and the various constraints provided.
Although the intended interpretation of these frames differs from the semantics for the metaphysical modal operators, the counterexamples and proofs for this section are much as they were before.

Note that the frame constraints provided in the Logic Notes are not intended to be exhaustive.
Some of the problems will require you to think a bit outside the box.

## Characterization

This section asks you to produce countermodels to each of the axioms that one might include in a tense logic before determining which constraints are needed in order to validate the axiom in question.
These countermodels and proofs are much as they were for the semantics for the metaphysical modal operators.

## Indeterminacy

This section considers an extension to the semantics in which sentences are evaluated at both a history and time.
In addition to evaluating some of the standard axioms included in tense logics, there are a number of claims which include the indeterminacy operators.
