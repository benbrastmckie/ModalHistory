# [Problem Set #3: Semantic Proofs](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistory?tab=readme-ov-file#problem-sets)

> Problem Set #3: Semantic Proofs (due prior to class week 05)

This problem set focuses on the semantic approach to modal logic, emphasizing the Kripke-style possible worlds semantics that we've discussed in class.

## Background

While the previous problem set explored axiomatic systems for modal logic, this assignment shifts our focus to semantics. The semantic approach provides a model-theoretic interpretation of modal operators through possible worlds and accessibility relations.

This transition from syntax to semantics mirrors the historical development of modal logic, particularly as seen in the work of Carnap and Kripke that we've been studying. Understanding both approaches gives us a more complete picture of modal logic.

## Instructions

1. Complete the semantic proofs in the `03_solutions.tex` file provided in this directory.
2. Follow the collaboration guidelines outlined in the [Problem Sets README](/problem_sets/README.md).
3. Make sure to add your name to the problems you're working on before beginning.
4. For each proof, clearly demonstrate the semantic structures (models) you're using.
5. Pay careful attention to the definitions of satisfaction, validity, and semantic consequence.

## Resources

- Review the semantic frameworks described in the [Logic Notes](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/LogicNotes)
- Refer to Kripke's "Semantical Analysis of Modal Logic I"
- Carnap's "Modalities and Quantification" provides important historical context

This problem set builds on the axiomatic work from the previous assignment while introducing a new perspective. The relationship between proof theory and model theory is a rich area of study in logic, and exploring both approaches enhances our understanding of modal systems.
