# [Problem Set #5: Bimodal Logic](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistory?tab=readme-ov-file#problem-sets)

> Problem Set #5: Bimodal Logic (due prior to class week 08)

This problem set explores bimodal logics, which combine two different types of modal operators within a single system. In particular, we'll focus on systems that combine temporal and alethic modalities.

## Background

Building on our work with modal logic and tense logic separately, this problem set examines how these systems can be integrated. Bimodal logics allow us to reason about the interaction between different modalities, such as necessity/possibility and past/future.

These systems are particularly relevant to the work of philosophers like Montague and Kaplan, who sought to develop comprehensive frameworks for intensional logic that could account for multiple dimensions of meaning.

## Instructions

1. Complete the proofs and exercises in the `05_solutions.tex` file provided in this directory.
2. Follow the collaboration guidelines outlined in the [Problem Sets README](/problem_sets/README.md).
3. Make sure to add your name to the problems you're working on before beginning.
4. Pay special attention to the interactions between the different modal operators and how their semantics can be integrated.
5. Consider the philosophical implications of these combined systems, particularly for questions about necessity, contingency, and time.

## Resources

- Review the bimodal logic sections in the [Logic Notes](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/LogicNotes)
- Montague's "The Proper Treatment of Quantification in Ordinary English"
- Kaplan's "Demonstratives"

Bimodal logics represent an important step toward more complex logical systems that can capture multiple dimensions of meaning. They demonstrate how the basic tools of modal logic can be extended and combined to address increasingly sophisticated philosophical questions.
