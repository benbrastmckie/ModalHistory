# [Problem Set #5: Bimodal Logic](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistory?tab=readme-ov-file#problem-sets)

This problem set concerns the semantics for _propositional bimodal logic_.
Please read the relevant portion of the [Logic Notes](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/LogicNotes) for the definitions.
A number of definitions are included in the [notation.sty](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistoryPrivate/blob/master/assets/notation.sty) file.
As always, feel free to open issues if there is anything that it would be helpful to discuss.

## Problem Set

> Overview of the sections in the problem set.

There are thirty problems for this week.
Work together to complete the [solutions](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistoryPrivate/blob/master/problem_sets/05_pset/05_solutions.tex) by writing 3/30 solutions for the problems for this week.
General information is provided in the [collaboration](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistoryPrivate/blob/master/problem_sets/collaboration.md) document.

## Cartesian Semantics

We begin by comparing Kaplan and Montague's semantics, both of which take worlds to be primitive where truth-conditions are sets of world-time pairs.

## Task Semantics

We then consider the task semantics for a bimodal language, checking that the perpetuity principles are indeed valid.

## Extensions

We then move to consider an extension which includes operators for the open past, future, and an inevitability operator.
These provide a number of options for regimenting the English sentences that have been included.

The problem set concludes by considering some mixed modal operators.
