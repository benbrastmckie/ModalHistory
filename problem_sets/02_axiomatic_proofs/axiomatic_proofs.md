# [Problem Set #2: Axiomatic Proofs](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistory?tab=readme-ov-file#problem-sets)

> Problem Set #2: Axiomatic Proofs (due prior to class week 03)

This problem set focuses on developing fluency with axiomatic proof systems of modal logic, particularly the systems of strict implication developed by C.I. Lewis.

## Background

As discussed in class, C.I. Lewis developed systems of strict implication (S1-S5) as an alternative to the material implication of *Principia Mathematica*. These systems aim to address the paradoxes of material implication by capturing a stronger notion of logical connection between propositions.

For this problem set, you will work through a series of proofs using the axiomatic systems introduced in the [Logic Notes](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/LogicNotes) and discussed in our readings, especially Lewis's "The Calculus of Strict Implication" and parts of *Symbolic Logic* (Lewis & Langford).

## Instructions

1. Complete the proofs in the `02_solutions.tex` file provided in this directory.
2. Follow the collaboration guidelines outlined in the [Problem Sets README](/problem_sets/README.md).
3. Make sure to add your name to the problems you're working on before beginning.
4. For each proof, indicate which axioms and rules of inference you are using at each step.
5. Remember that the goal is not just to complete the problems, but to develop a deep understanding of axiomatic modal logic.

## Resources

- Review the axiomatic systems described in the [Logic Notes](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/LogicNotes)
- Refer to Lewis's papers, especially "The Calculus of Strict Implication" and the appendix to *Symbolic Logic*
- Remember to check for any supplementary notes shared on the course repository

If you encounter difficulties or have questions, don't hesitate to open an issue in the repository. This is a collaborative process, and discussing the problems benefits everyone's understanding.
