## Hyperintensionality via Counterfactuals

- Motivation: semantics for counterfactuals was hyperintensional
  - Aim to better understand the theoretical commitments
  - Want to know why propositions take the form that they do

## Hyperintensionality via Aboutness

- Worldly propositions: things being a certain way
  - Typically partial
- Conservative methodology: 
  - Minimally departing from a Boolean theory of propositions
  - Necessary equivalence + subject-matter

## Propositions and Propositional Identity

- Boolean Propositions
  - Extensional theories of propositions validate the Boolean identities
  - Same hold for intensional theories of propositions
  - Differ in how many propositions there are
- Intensionalism: sets of maximal possibilities (world states)
  - Partiality is captured through abstraction
  - Propositional identity is necessary equivalence
  - Boolean identities
- Primitivism: propositional identity is to be axiomatized
  - But where to begin?
  - Idempotence? Absorption?
  - Need some theoretical role or application
- Truth-conditions: set of possible worlds
  - Semantics to guide us
  - Makes Necs and Imps valid
  - Also makes Abs1 and Abs2 valid
- Does not track subject-matter
  - Not all applications may require this
  - Counterfactuals required this because we wanted to make minimal changes
  - But the bimodal logics we looked at don't need this

## Augmenting Intensionalism

- Sets of possible worlds together with X
  - Why assume that a theory of propositions should be factored in this way?
  - Methodologically it feels derivative and perhaps dogmatic
  - Also limited by the grain of an intensional theory
- Partitions as subject-matters
  - "P is about M iff each cell of M either implies or contradicts P."
  - So propositions have many subject-matters
  - M includes (refines) N iff every cell of N is a union of cells of M
  - "There are more than a hundred stars" has many partitions
  - Non-contingent propositions are about every subject-matter
  - "...there is no way at all for two worlds to give it different truth values, a fortiori there is no way for two worlds to give it different truth values"
  - "gold has 79 protons" and "2+2=5" have the same subject-matters?
  - Still get absorption: two sides have the same subject-matters
  - Fundamental problem is that we are using something maximal to model something partial
- Doing better
  - Nothing should compel us to live with these defects if we don't have to
  - Want subject-matter to be unique (functional)
  - Also want subject-matter to be worldly
  - 'Morning star is rising' and 'Evening star is rising' have the same subject-matter
  - Don't need this to be the only theory of subject-matter
  - Instead of seeing what we can live with, it is worth starting fresh
  - What would we ideally want in a theory of subject-matter

## Towards a Theory of Subject-Matter

- Propositional Operator
  - Uniqueness points us to a function from propositions
  - But what are subject-matters themselves?
  - Are subject-matters objects, properties, propositions?
- If anything other that propositions, then we don't have a propositional operator
  - Can't conjoin, disjoin, or negate subject-matters
  - Fine provides an analogue of conjunction but not disjunction or negation
  - There doesn't need to be a single answer here
  - Practical to stay with propositional operators as long as we can manage
- Analytic Equivalence
  - Can use propositional identity to say when two propositional have the same subject-matter
  - Can state the objectivity/worldliness of the present theory with propositional identity
  - Want many of the Boolean identities to preserve subject-matter
  - Conjunctions and disjunctions have the same subject-matter
  - Also want negation to preserve subject-matter
- Representational Subject-Matter
  - Could differ considerably, perhaps operating on sentences instead of propositions
  - Suppose "H is rising" and "P is rising" have different subject-matters
  - If subject-matter is what sentences is about, these sentences differ in what they are about
  - But neither sentence is about anything representational
  - Perhaps the difference in subject-matter is simply a function of representational differences
  - Makes sense to develop an objective theory first
  - These are not incompatible projects but rather build on each other
- Objective Subject-Matter
  - Objectivity gives us a way to identify subject-matters and distinguish propositions
  - We have some loose grip in the form of defeasible desiderata for identical subject-matters
  - Can use this guide our way towards a theory of propositions that is sensitive to differences in subject-matter
  - But it will help to provide a connection between subject-matter and relevance to give us another foothold
- Relevance and Subject-Matter
  - The same propositions are relevant to identical subject-matters
  - Important that relevance is also understood to be worldly/objective
  - A is relevant to both A \wedge B and to A \vee B
  - Consider some A that is not relevant to B \vee \neg B
  - Since A is relevant to A \vee \neg A, we know that A \vee \neg A is not identical to B \vee \neg B
  - Similar for conjunction
- Absorption
  - Suppose B is not relevant to A, but B is relevant to A \vee (A \wedge B)
  - So the absorption laws do not hold
  - So we need a non-Boolean theory of propositions if we are to preserve these differences in subject-matter

## Towards a Theory of Propositional Identity

- Core Identity Principles
  - Anything deserving of the name 'identity' should be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive
  - I will also assume that propositional identity entails material implication
- Transparency and Leibniz's Law
  - We also want identities to warrant substitutions in transparent contexts
  - But transparency is best characterized in terms of identity
  - Defining what it is for an operator to be transparent in terms of propositional identity is enough
  - Can then derive Leibniz's Law in languages which only have transparent operators
  - Can then derived that propositional identity entails strict equivalence
- Identity Axioms
  - Include as many Boolean identities as we can without offending the subject-matter principles
  - We can then derive many of the subject-matter principles given transparency of subject-matter
  - A question remains about distribution
  - It would seem that distribution preserves subject-matter
  - But there turns out to be reason to reject this
  - It will help to provide a semantics in order to see this

## State Semantics  

- Complete lattice
  - Don't need possible states for this project
  - Theory of propositions is similar but simpler than it was before
  - Also going to restrict attention to the first-degree fragment
  - So we just need to interpret \neg, \vee, and \wedge
- Closure
  - The closure constraint is motivated by idempotence
  - We have already done this
- Uniformity
  - Sentence letters can express anything that a well-formed sentence can express
  - Permits uniform substitution of complex sentences for sentence letters
- Inclusive Semantics
  - Recall that the semantics for disjunction/conjunction was inclusive
  - Without inclusivity, then closure is not preserved by disjunction/conjunction
  - So uniformity may fail to hold
  - Idempotence provides reason to maintain the inclusive semantics
- Exclusive Semantics
  - Could define the inclusive operators from their exclusive counterparts
  - But the exclusive counterparts would promote closure failures
  - So uniformity would not hold if propositions are required to be closed
  - If propositions are not required to be closed, then idempotence fails for inclusive and exclusive operators
- Propositional Identity
  - The semantics is forced on us by the theory of propositions
  - Could provide a full propositional logic by taking true identities to be verified by the null state
  - Don't gain too much for my purposes here
  - Provide the theory of logical consequence

## Logic of Propositional Identity  

- Countermodels
  - Follows immediately that Imps and Necs are invalid `CL_CM_1 - CL_CM_2`
  - Absorption is also invalid `CL_CM_5 - CL_CM_6`
  - However, `A \vee (A \wedge B) \equiv A \wedge (A \vee B)` is valid `CL_TH_9`
  - Both Dist1 and Dist2 also turn out to be invalid `CL_CM_7 - CL_CM_8`
- Distribution
  - Both Dist1 and Dist2 are necessary equivalences
  - Not obvious that they relate propositions with different subject-matters
  - Whatever intuitive grasp we might have on subject-matter is pretty limited and can't help here
  - But we can appeal to the countermodels to help
- Exact Verification/Falsification
  - The parts of an exact verifier/falsifier may fail to be exact verifier/falsifier
  - The states between exact verifiers/falsifiers may also fail
  - A state that is a fusion of an exact verifier and a part of an exact verifier still is partially irrelevant
  - "The ball is colored", "The ball is shaped", "The ball is metallic"
- Convexity
  - Fine also requires propositional contestants to be convex
  - A proposition that is closed and convex is called regular
  - But convexity is not preserved by the inclusive semantics
  - So uniformity fails to hold
  - Could go for the super inclusive semantics which forces convexity to be preserved
- Nonvacuous Annihilation
  - If there are vacuous propositions, then the super inclusive semantics breaks down
  - Disjoining a proposition with no verifiers to one with verifiers does not have verifiers
  - Could restrict to nonvacuous models, but this is ad hoc
- Bounded and Complete
  - Boolean theories are bounded and complete
  - There is a proposition that entails all propositions and one that is entailed by all propositions
  - Completeness entails boundedness since all propositions must then have a lub and glb
  - But if there are no vacuous propositions, there is no lower bound between disjoint propositions
  - A conservative methodology should resist giving up boundedness and completeness without substantial motivation
